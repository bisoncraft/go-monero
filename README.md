## This Fork

Thanks to the developers of MoneroPay!

This fork is based on MoneroPay and is for integration into dex. It updates by introducing daemon rpc functions with both the older RPC's (see the README.md in `old_rpc` directory) and the newer JSON 2.0 RPC calls (see the README.md in `rpc` directory)

Tested on `stagenet` and `regtest`

`main.go` currently set up to run against regtest `harness.sh`
